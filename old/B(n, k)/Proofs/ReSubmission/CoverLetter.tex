To whom it may concern,

I am submitting this article for publication in your journal, {\bf Advances in Mathematics}. This is the only and first 
journal I am submitting the article to. The author instructions requested that I suggest an appropriate editor. I believe 
that Anders Bj\"orner would be approriate.
